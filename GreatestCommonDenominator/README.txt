GreatestCommonDenominator.java

While the user wants to make a calculation, this program prompts the user for 
two integers -- in the order from greatest to smallest. 

Then it finds the greatest common denominator between the two by finding the 
remainder of the division between the two numbers recursively until the 
remainder is 0.

It prints out the result.
